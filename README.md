# AI-Enhanced Websites with LLM APIs

Leveraging **LLM APIs** is an effective way to transform standard websites into interactive, AI-driven platforms. In this project, we demonstrate how LLM APIs can be seamlessly utilised to create powerful features like a chatbot and a sentiment analysis system, adding intelligence and engagement to the website with ease.

Through the LLM-powered chatbot, users enjoy real-time, responsive interactions, while the sentiment analysis system automatically processes feedback to uncover customer insights. This project showcases the versatility and efficiency of LLM APIs in building advanced, user-centered web features that enhance the overall digital experience.

## Liverpool Larder - A Showcase of LLM API-Enhanced Food Ordering Platform

**Liverpool Larder** is a sample food ordering website designed on **Bubble.io** to illustrate how **Large Language Model (LLM) APIs** can significantly enhance website interactions and functionality. This project utilizes the **Gemini API** to power **ChefBot**, an AI chatbot that assists users with personalized recommendations and answers to common queries, creating a seamless and interactive experience. Additionally, a **Sentiment Analysis System** analyzes user reviews to extract valuable feedback, helping the platform continuously improve its service.

**While the Gemini API is used here, similar results can be achieved with other LLM APIs, such as ChatGPT. These APIs offer versatile options for integrating intelligent features like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and personalized recommendations, making LLM technology an invaluable tool for enriching any website.**

### Website Creation Using Bubble.io

The **Liverpool Larder** platform was developed entirely on **Bubble.io**, which allowed for rapid and adaptable web development without requiring extensive coding knowledge. The choice of Bubble.io as the development platform was made to enable quick prototyping, easy modifications, and efficient management of both front-end and back-end components.

## Sentiment Analysis

The **Sentiment Analysis** feature was developed to help Liverpool Larder gain valuable insights into customer experiences. After placing orders, customers frequently leave feedback in the form of comments, offering insights into their likes and any areas needing improvement. However, manually analyzing this feedback can be time-consuming and inconsistent. By incorporating sentiment analysis, administrators can automatically assess the tone of each review—whether positive, negative, or neutral—enabling data-driven decisions to improve service quality.

### Implementation Approach Using Gemini API

The sentiment analysis system was implemented using the **Gemini API**, integrated within the **Bubble** platform to streamline the feedback analysis process. This setup allows for the automated categorization of customer comments, giving administrators actionable insights in real time.

- **Data Collection**: Feedback data is gathered whenever a customer leaves a comment. These comments are sent to the Gemini API through API workflows created in Bubble, ensuring feedback is collected and processed consistently without manual intervention.

- **Sentiment Analysis via Gemini API**: The feedback data is processed by the Gemini API, which applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the text and determine sentiment. By examining key words, context, and phrases, the API classifies each review into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. This approach leverages advanced AI algorithms, making the sentiment analysis accurate and reliable.

- **Integration with the Admin Panel**: The sentiment analysis results are displayed in the Admin Panel, allowing administrators to view a summary of customer sentiment. The integration with Bubble ensures that sentiment analysis outcomes are accessible and easy to interpret, enabling administrators to quickly assess overall feedback sentiment and address any emerging issues.
