# AI-Enhanced Websites with LLM APIs

Leveraging **LLM APIs** is an effective way to transform standard websites into interactive, AI-driven platforms. In this project, we demonstrate how LLM APIs can be seamlessly utilised to create powerful features like a chatbot and a sentiment analysis system, adding intelligence and engagement to the website with ease.

Through the LLM-powered chatbot, users enjoy real-time, responsive interactions, while the sentiment analysis system automatically processes feedback to uncover customer insights. This project showcases the versatility and efficiency of LLM APIs in building advanced, user-centered web features that enhance the overall digital experience.

## Liverpool Larder - A Showcase of LLM API-Enhanced Food Ordering Platform

**Liverpool Larder** is a fictional food ordering website designed on **Bubble.io** to illustrate how **Large Language Model (LLM) APIs** can significantly enhance website interactions and functionality. This project utilizes the **Gemini API** to power **ChefBot**, an AI chatbot that assists users with personalized recommendations and answers to common queries, creating a seamless and interactive experience. Additionally, a **Sentiment Analysis System** analyzes user reviews to extract valuable feedback, helping the platform continuously improve its service.


**While the Gemini API is used here, similar results can be achieved with other LLM APIs, such as ChatGPT. These APIs offer versatile options for integrating intelligent features like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and personalized recommendations, making LLM technology an invaluable tool for enriching any website.**
